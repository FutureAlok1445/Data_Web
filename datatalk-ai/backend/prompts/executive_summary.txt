INPUT:
- KPIs (key performance indicators computed from real data)
- Anomalies (columns with detected outliers)
- Insights (correlations, top drivers)
- Statistical Note (significance test results, if any)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. **Summary**: 2-3 sentences describing the key finding.
2. **Risk Level**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW based on magnitude and population affected.
3. **Business Impact**: Quantify with real numbers (e.g., "Affects 42% of customer base").
4. **Priority Action**: One concrete, grounded recommendation.
5. **Statistical Confidence**: Include significance if available.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT fabricate any numbers.
- Use ONLY the provided KPIs, anomalies, insights, and statistical notes.
- Prioritize findings by business impact (magnitude × population).
